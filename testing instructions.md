Debugging Local Application & Verifying Integration
I have generated 3,600 app-inspired lessons and integrated 111 static items into the database. I also fixed 180 malformed lesson content entries. Currently, the local application is rendering a blank screen due to React hook errors and API misrouting. I am now transitioning to fixing these blockers to complete the full application audit.

###############################################################################################
Perform exhaustive programmatic testing of every lesson and feature in the application.
Ensure that each component, screen, lesson, and data file is fully functional, correctly linked, and integrated into the primary application flow. No orphaned modules, unused data files, broken routes, or disconnected lessons should remain.
Identify, report, and correct any lesson, dataset, asset, or logic that is not properly connected to the core app architecture. All lessons and data must be actively utilized in a coherent and intelligent manner, maximizing pedagogical effectiveness and system integrity.
Specifically verify and fix:
Proper placement, rendering, and behavior of the Saraswati Mascot
Correct discovery, routing, and accessibility of the Home component
Simulate real-world usage by automated user testing, covering:
125 Beginner users
75 Intermediate users
51 Advanced users
Each simulated user must:
Randomly access 90% of the total lessons available in the app
Navigate through lessons, quizzes, transitions, and UI flows without encountering errors, dead ends, or logical inconsistencies
Guarantee zero user-blocking issues across all test cases.
Fix, refactor, and optimize any discovered issues so that no user—regardless of skill level—faces functional, navigational, or data-integration problems.
###############################################################################################
Act as a senior AI software testing and integration agent.
Perform full programmatic testing of the entire application by rigorously validating every lesson, feature, component, route, asset, and data file.
Objectives & Mandatory Actions:
End-to-End Functional Validation
Test every lesson individually and as part of the complete learning flow.
Ensure every UI element, button, route, component, and interaction is functional and correctly linked to the main application flow.
Data & Asset Integrity Check
Identify any data file, lesson content, asset, or resource that is not integrated into the main app.
Explicitly point out such gaps, fix them, and fully integrate all unused or orphaned data into the application logic.
Core Component Verification
Fix and correctly integrate the SaraswatiMascot component.
Locate, verify, and properly connect the Home component as the root navigation anchor of the app.
User Simulation Testing (Mandatory)
Simulate testing with the following user groups:
125 Beginner users
75 Intermediate users
51 Advanced users
Each simulated user must randomly consume 90% of all lessons available in the app.
Ensure no user encounters errors, dead ends, broken navigation, missing content, or inconsistent behavior.
Quality & Excellence Standard
Use all lessons and data brilliantly, ensuring maximum educational coherence and technical robustness.
Apply best-in-class reasoning, architecture awareness, and optimization intelligence while fixing issues.
Final Requirement
The application must reach a state where every path works flawlessly, all content is discoverable, and no beginner, intermediate, or advanced user faces any problem under any realistic usage scenario.
Deliver a fully fixed, integrated, and production-ready application.
###############################################################################################
Optional Ultra-Strict Version (AI Agent Mode)
If you want it even stronger for an autonomous AI agent:
Act as a senior QA engineer, full-stack architect, and pedagogy optimizer. Validate the application end-to-end under heavy simulated load and randomized lesson access. Treat every failure as critical and resolve it permanently. Deliver a 100% lesson coverage, zero-defect learning experience.
